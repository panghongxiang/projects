# ![](../images/GA-logo.png) Project 1: Data Analysis of Singapore Rainfall

## Overview

This is the slide deck prepared as part of the group project to analyse and visual a selected problem statement among the group members (Pang Hong Xiang, Cheryl Lim and Wen Yu Sheng). We selected Cheryl's problem statement to be visualised. The selected problem statement and its background is detailed below.

## Background

According to the [Meteorological Services Singapore](http://www.weather.gov.sg/climate-climate-of-singapore/#:~:text=Singapore%20is%20situated%20near%20the,month%2Dto%2Dmonth%20variation.), Singapore has a typical tropical climate with adundant rainfall, high and uniform temperatures and high humidity all year round, since its situated near the equator. There are many factors that help us understand the climate of a country and in this project we are going to look into a few, especially rainfall.

Singapore’s climate is characterised by two main monsoon seasons separated by inter-monsoonal periods.  The **Northeast Monsoon** occurs from December to early March, and the **Southwest Monsoon** from June to September.

The major weather systems affecting Singapore that can lead to heavy rainfall are:

- Monsoon surges, or strong wind episodes in the Northeast Monsoon flow bringing about major rainfall events;

- Sumatra squalls, an organised line of thunderstorms travelling eastward across Singapore, having developed over the island of Sumatra or Straits of Malacca west of us;

- Afternoon and evening thunderstorms caused by strong surface heating and by the sea breeze circulation that develops in the afternoon.

Singapore’s climate station has been located at several different sites in the past 140 years. The station had been decommissioned at various points in the past due to changes to local land use in the site’s vicinity, and had to be relocated. Since 1984, the climate station has been located at **Changi**.

There are other metrics of climate such as temperature, humidity, sun shine duration, wind speed, cloud cover etc. All the dataset used in the project comes from [data.gov.sg](data.gov.sg), as recorded at the Changi climate station

## Problem Statement

With a small land mass that is almost completely urbanised ('concrete jungle'), hot, humid weather that often involves rain, Singaporeans often lament that there is little to do and explore in Singapore. Citizens typically engage in their usual physical activites (for eg. going to the gym, running, etc.) or eschew them altogether in favour of activities that will allow them to avoid the hot and oftentimes rainy weather. 

On the other hand, the government of Singapore often encourages its citizens to lead healthy, active lifestyles. To this end, organisations such as People's Association are heavily involved in this, often coming up with plans and initiatives that are then implemented by, for example, Residents' Committees. Almost completely urbanised and a 'concrete jungle', these initiatives frequently involve outdoors activities, or activities that at least require some mobility.

Unfortunately, the weather is not always on our side. Singaporeans are all too aware of our country's climate. Some ignore it and persist in what they want to do while others preemptively avoid outdoor activities. Some may not have a choice, such as the elderly. Events may be cancelled on the day itself in the event of adverse weather. 

This project aims to minimise the abovementioned issues by analysing the local weather trends. Armed with such knowledge, organisations will be able to plan for activities with the weather in mind, which in turn will likely increase take-up rate and reduce wastage of resources (time, effort, manpower and money that goes down the train when events are cancelled). The success of these events will encourage more people to participate, and imbue organisers with the confidence to be more ambitious in their plans for future events.
